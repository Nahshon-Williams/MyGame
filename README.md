# MyGame
Making a "simple" game in python using pygame. Very cool and fun.

I think making games is a great way to use many different programming concepts, and to learn some adjacent skills. We've got to make classes for characters 
and images, understand a few things about animation and framerates, use clock functions, manipulate the available hardware on the machine, etc. 


# Maps
I'm actually building a map system that takes json objects as data for building level maps. "Why on earth would you do that?" you may be thinking. "You could 
just use a nested list, it would be so much easier". Yes it would. But there are some critical benefits to this method. Using a separate file for maps means 
that users could potentially make their own (fun!). Text files could work, but i think json has a nicer balance between human readable and program readable.
Also, I am a data engineer and I use json all the time, so it's quite familiar to me. And finally, the more complicated I make this, the more fun it will be.
